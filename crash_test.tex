\noindent \textbf{Insufficient Instructors for Courses:}

\noindent Description: There may not be enough instructors to fill some classes if the weighted total of the professors' preferences (0.5, 1, and 1.5) is less than or equal to the entire number of courses.

\noindent For instance, if there are four courses and the total weightage is three, then at least one course might not be assigned.

\noindent 

\noindent \textbf{Excess Professors, Some Unallocated:}

\noindent In cases where the overall weightage of professors exceeds the number of courses, certain professors may not receive full allocation or may receive no allocation at all.

\noindent Example: Some professors with a total weightage of 1.5 may not be assigned if the weightages add up to 6 and there are only 4 courses.

\noindent 

\noindent \textbf{Partial Allocation of Courses:}

\noindent Description: In the event that a professor with a weightage of 0.5 has preferences for specific courses (such cdc\_x) that no other professor possesses, then those courses may be partially allocated to that professor, perhaps resulting in cases that are not feasible.

\noindent Example: CDC1 and CDC2 are partially assigned because a professor with a weightage of 0.5 has preferences for them, but no other professor shares these preferences.

\noindent 

\noindent \textbf{No Common Preferences:}

\noindent If there are courses that are not preferred by any of the instructors, they might not be assigned.

\noindent Example: No professor has cdc25 in their preferences, and cdc25 is not offered to any professor, resulting in an unallocated course.

\noindent 

\noindent \textbf{Inconsistent Naming Conventions:}

\noindent The code uses particular naming conventions to identify professors and courses. If while giving input

\noindent of the courses in the first line using naming conventions like cdc1 or cdc2 {\dots}. and while giving preferences of the professor, if the naming convention is different, both will be treated different and not give intended results i.e case sensitive as well

\noindent For instance, if a course is called "cdcX" in the first line and "cdc\_x," in preference order, it might not be identified, which could cause problems.

\noindent if a course is called "cdcX" in the first line and "cdcx," in preference order, it might not be identified, which could cause problems.
